# Roadmap

## Stage 0 — secure foundation (complete)

GUI/tray, provider boundary, structured plans, tool registry, risk review,
confirmation, audit, rollback contract, R0 metadata scanner, tests, and CI.

## Stage 1 — read-only analysis (complete)

Large-file reporting, cautious idle-file evidence and confidence, staged
duplicate detection, exports, richer filtering, user-managed roots/exclusions,
structured model planning, aggregate-only explanation, audit, and a 10,000-file
benchmark. Installed-software inventory remains an unimplemented MVP item and is
planned as a separate read-only Stage 1B/Stage 3 increment.

## Stage 2A — safe file operations (complete)

Ordinary directory creation, same-volume file/directory move, same-parent structured
rename, real Preview, conflict/limit checks, persistent transaction and item states,
write-ahead Undo, result verification, crash interruption recovery, reverse-order
rollback, separate rollback confirmation, GUI history, and Windows integration tests.

Overwrite, cross-volume move, arbitrary rename code, and deletion are deliberately absent.

## Stage 2B — Windows recycle bin (planned)

Windows recycle-bin integration requires a separate R2 object-specific confirmation,
truthful MANUAL/PARTIAL restoration semantics, and operation verification. Permanent
deletion remains prohibited.

## Stage 3 — system status

Read-only disk, CPU, memory, process, startup, service, software, and performance
views. No system mutation.

## Later stages

Each R3 capability receives an independent threat model, implementation, test
plan, and review. Voice, office/browser automation, schedules, and cross-platform
adapters follow only after the safety boundary is stable.
