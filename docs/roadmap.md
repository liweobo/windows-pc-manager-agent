# Roadmap

## Stage 0 — secure foundation (complete)

GUI/tray, provider boundary, structured plans, tool registry, risk review,
confirmation, audit, rollback contract, R0 metadata scanner, tests, and CI.

## Stage 1 — read-only analysis (complete)

Large-file reporting, cautious idle-file evidence and confidence, staged
duplicate detection, exports, richer filtering, user-managed roots/exclusions,
structured model planning, aggregate-only explanation, audit, and a 10,000-file
benchmark. Installed-software inventory remains an unimplemented MVP item and is
planned as a separate read-only Stage 1B/Stage 3 increment.

## Stage 2A — safe file operations (complete)

Ordinary directory creation, same-volume file/directory move, same-parent structured
rename, real Preview, conflict/limit checks, persistent transaction and item states,
write-ahead Undo, result verification, crash interruption recovery, reverse-order
rollback, separate rollback confirmation, GUI history, and Windows integration tests.

Overwrite, cross-volume move, arbitrary rename code, and deletion are deliberately absent.

## Stage 2B — Windows recycle bin (complete)

Explicitly selected files/directories can be moved to the Windows Recycle Bin after
strict local-volume capability checks, recursive identity snapshots, R2 plan approval,
fresh revalidation, and a second short-lived object-specific confirmation. Each item has
write-ahead MANUAL recovery evidence and Shell callback verification. Automatic restore,
permanent deletion, emptying the Recycle Bin, and non-system volumes remain prohibited.

## Stage 3 — system status (complete)

Read-only Windows identity, multi-sample CPU, memory/pagefile, local fixed disks,
metadata-only process inventory, Run/Startup entries, SCM service queries, uninstall-registry
software inventory, deterministic threshold findings, partial failure, cancellation, audit,
optional minimal-data model explanation, and a dashboard. No system mutation, command-line
collection, shell, WMI, elevation, malware diagnosis, or `Win32_Product`.

## Stage 4 — controlled system operations (not started)

Process termination, startup/service changes, software uninstall, and other R3 operations
remain design-only. Each capability requires its own threat model, confirmation design,
recovery plan, Windows API experiment, and isolated test/review before any implementation.

## Later stages

Each R3 capability receives an independent threat model, implementation, test
plan, and review. Voice, office/browser automation, schedules, and cross-platform
adapters follow only after the safety boundary is stable.
